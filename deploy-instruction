#Fresh Cent 7.5 Minimal install, Running on DellR610 w/ 2x Xeon 5650X(Westmere), FreeNAS for storage, pfSense for DNS

#SETUP STORAGE
#Ovirt Engine needs NFS/iscsi share of 80G minimum, we will use NFS here. Create a dataset and set nobody:nobody permissions, wrx+ for User and Group. 
#Then in the share tab, under Advanced, set MapAll User and MapAll Group to nobody:nobody
#Ensure the shares are on correct binding networks with correct permissions From a linux host or the Engine Host after initial install, run to confirm that your NFS server is ready.  
#This is version3 over TCP 
rpcinfo -t remote_nfs_server_ip nfs 3

#SETUP DNS
# Free nas has host and domain overrides in the DNS Resolver service. A record entry supposedly creates PTR records, 
# but to be safe I added reverse dns entries as A records, example: 
#  Host     1
#  Domain   1.168.192.in-addr.arpa  
#  Address  192.168.1.1
#  pfSense does this IPV6 DHCP nonsense now that fucks my /etc/hosts up, so I'm not DHCP'ing this at all


#CENTOS 7 Install
# Set your network up during install as static ip with hostname and dns set
# You have to customize the partitions, the defaults will not work
# Partition your drive and ensure the /var partition is added and has 65 GiB.  Utilize the remaining space accordingly, 
# I keep /home to 20 GiB, boot at 1GiB, swap at ~25% of your host total RAM, and the remainder to the / partition. 
# My R610 local 140GB Virtual Disk seems to be the smallest disk I can get by with safely here 

#Set SELinux to permissive
sed -i 's/=enforcing/=permissive/g' /etc/sysconfig/selinux
sed -i 's/=enforcing/=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0

#Enable Nested VM features. Look thru /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/ and enable as needed. Google for AMD chips.
echo "options kvm_intel nested=1" >> /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-nested
echo "options kvm_intel enable_shadow_vmcs=1" >> /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-nested

modprobe -r kvm_intel;
modprobe -a kvm_intel;

#Kill NetworkManager, it usefully created the base configs for your ISCSI interfaces (if any), but it will likely cause problems later
systemctl stop NetworkManager
systemctl disable NetworkManager

#Install rpm, update, install needed packages, and reboot.
yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm -y; yum update -y; 
yum install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup -y; yum install ovirt-engine-appliance -y; reboot

#Double check your /etc/resolv.conf, sometimes lookups only try IPV6.  On that, in my network configs, I remove all *IPV6* entries.
#You can add the FQDN for Host and Engine in /etc/hosts, but I found this step unneccesary
#Double check now with nslookup on <engine-fqdn> and <host-fqdn> to make sure it resolves (FQDN to IP), 
#also lookup IP's to ensure record exists for reverse DNS lookup (IP to FQDN)

#Install hosted-engine
screen -S deploy
hosted-engine --deploy
#In the answers, I choose not to add entry to /etc/hosts for Engine VM as I've seen silly entries go in there.  Your (optional) static entries and 
#properly configured DNS resolver will take care of this anyway
#Most everything default is acceptable save for you nfs and other specified answers.

#TO ADD - Fucking Multipath iSCSI on ovirt is a bitch, need to figure it out and update here

#Edit: The above changes are all I needed, I can see that writes to disks on the ISCSI Lun's are in fact multi pathing round robin.
